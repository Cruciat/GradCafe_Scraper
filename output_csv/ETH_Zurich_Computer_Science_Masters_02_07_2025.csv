For all future applicants: You have to put your qualifications into context. Having a GPA of 9/10 means absolutely nothing if there are a lot of students(>10%) with 9/10 or more or if your university does not have many competitive students(ranking does not matter-there are universities that are ranked in a low position globally but attract many good native students). Likewise, in some University systems doing an internship in summer or publishing 2-3 papers before graduating is the norm, while in others it is virtually unheard of. Do not be discouraged if you see other people that seem to have much better qualifications than you do. Not everything that shines is gold, and not all gold shines equally bright. Best of luck to everything you do."
